  The item (MSI graphic card RTX3060) was already defective at the time when I received it. However, the seller charged me the restocking fee of $300 even though I returned it in the original condition that complies to the return policy.  There was a critically missing part on the tiny gold-colored sensor chip when i open it.When I turn my computer on, the new MSI graphic card fans was spinning and soon afterwards, all the power to the card suddenly dropped dead. So  I reinstalled my old graphic card that works fine with my computer.  The fact that i have to pay for the product's defect that the seller is responsible for is outrageous!

  Overall good product, reason I'm rating it 1 star is because it's overpriced.

  Card is great. The fact that everything on this site is marked up astronomically due to the shortage. But everyone has to make a buck somehow off the supply and demand. But it wasn’t a picture of a gpu so that’s a plus. Thanks

  Great card. Packed well shipped fast. One star for price gauging me at 3x MSRP, otherwise would have been 5.

  I'd give this 5 stars if it was not so OVERPRICED!!! I paid $1000 for a card that the MRP is set for $350. Other than that this video's performance is amazing!

  So, I too hate the high price of the card, but I knew what the price was going into the buy. I don't blame the seller for trying to make a profit during a shortage. I'd probably do the same thing if I were in their place.That said, the product functions as advertised and is exactly what they promise. It sucks there's a shortage going around. I'd have rather spent this money on a more upgraded product, but I needed something new to get the most out of a new monitor I bought. This card works just fine for that.

  Does really well with games.  Had an RTX 2070 and upgraded to this.  There was a noticeable difference.  However, this card runs really hot.  Had to adjust my fan speeds in MSI Afterburner to keep this cool.  Then, had to take off my front and back panels on my case for it to go open air.  Card climbs past 70 degrees celcius quick.  And unfortunately, I haven't found any water blocks for this card if you want to run liquid cooling.  I also use it for Crypto mining.  You will have to install an older driver in order to mine with it and you will have to use a HDMI dummy plug if you don't have it plugged into a monitor.  Otherwise, it will quit mining on you after a few minutes - even if you turn off your monitor.  For mining, I ended up running tandem GPUs - the 3060 and the 2070.  For mining, I use the 2070 as my display GPU and put the dummy plug in the 3060.  For gaming, I use the 3060 as my display GPU and mine with the 2070 at the same time.

  My setup included a Be Quiet fan and a 5600x CPU, and this GPU ran pretty well with the CPU and was as quiet as my fan. It can run FPS games very smoothly and you can easily max out the settings for most games like Nier Automata. The only downside was buying it at a very high price because we’re in the middle of a GPU shortage. It’s not worth buying by itself if you’re considering building your own PC (the mistake I made). Otherwise, it’s best to buy a prebuilt with a better GPU like a 3060ti or 3070 if your budget can take it.

  Now let me start my review with a fair warning, I bought and am currently using this card for gaming. I am not interested in crypto or other uses for this card, I bought it for mainly gaming.The RTX 3060 is a very nice card for gaming. I myself have benchmarked and tested this card on all of my high end games. Shadow of the Tomb Raider, War Thunder, Rainbow Six Siege, Minecraft RTX, and COD MW all ran well over 130fps at high graphics.Acoustics are very nice. I use MSI Afterburner to control my fan speed and to kick in the fans for extra cooling while gaming. When the fans are idling you can barely even hear them running and when they kick in you can certainly hear them but it isn't too loud.Temps on this card have so far been very nice. I idle at around 28-35 C and when I benchmarked it on some high end games I barely peaked at around 65C and averaged around 58-63C.Overall its a very nice card. But I have one last thing to say.It is not worth the current price. Scalpers and miners are all trying to sell their cards for 2 or 3 times MSRP and unless your desperate or just really want a 30 series card, I would not recommend buying this now. I paid 750+ dollars for this just because I have been waiting for a GPU for nearly 3 months and caved in. But I encourage you to wait for as long as you can.
