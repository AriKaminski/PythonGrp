Jake,1,terrible product
RM,1,Ordered new came used. Disrespectful especially for a scalper. Do not recommend
TotallyKitty,5,It’s good. Like all of YouTube says; it only performs as good as a 2060 super when gaming and like a 2080ti when video editing. Power consumption is a few points below the 2060 super (I’m getting 125w while testing defaults.) fans are silent even when at 100%
