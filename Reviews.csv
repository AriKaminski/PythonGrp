Anonymous,Overall Review: I recommend it.  I used it to diagnose a Mini Cooper and it was awesome. Display shows short code description as well as the code.
Paul K.,"Pros: Simple to use - plug it into car's ODBII port and it reads the cars data and lets you clear engine warning codes by scrolling through the diagnostic screens.  No batteries required.  Screen was easy to see in bright outside light.

Price - can't beat a price less than a premium pizza AND it had free shipping

Shipping - OK - got here more or less on time - took about 8 days from NJ to TX

FINALLY - A BIG PRO for a lot of folks - this model has lots of YT videos so you can see how it is used before you buy or hook it up to your vehicle.  This helps with the so-so documentation.Cons: The manual is pretty small (if you are of a certain age, you will need a magnifying glass) and some parts are unclear (i.e. poorly written) on how the unit should be hooked up or used.   The manual does have some screenshots to make things more understandable though.  

Fortunately, for the less clear parts,  the YT videos come in handy (just search for V310 ODBII car diagnostic tool).

Not really the sellers fault but the delivery was a little slow due to the USPS leaving it sitting at the initial and intermediate shipping sites for an extra day or two.  It got here which is what matters.Overall Review: I'd recommend it to someone who is not a professional mechanic (or even an advanced amateur).  While it does the basic code read and reset, it is lacking in some of the more advanced diagnostics and realtime readouts of engine performance so those type folks are going to want to pay a little more and get a more advanced unit.

For me, IT WORKED JUST AS I HOPED so I could clear a sticking MASS FUEL AIR FILTER warning on my old Nissan that keeps setting everytime we get a cold, foggy, rainy day which is rare in Texas (has happened about 3 times over the life of the car).  I just wanted that cleared so the main Check Engine light would go out.  That way, in case something worse was happening in the engine, it would show immediately.

The 4  egg rating was based on me taking off a point for the documentation.  Sorry - spend a little more for the manual paper to size it to the size of the shipping box and have a novice proofread it and try to use the unit as it says before printing it."
Anonymous,Pros: Very easy to use. It is feature rich for the price.Overall Review: I would recommend this.
Kollier B.,"Overall Review: Very easy plug and play tool, used for a CEL so far and it pulled the codes no problem. Also reads a bunch of other live diagnostic data. Absolute must have for the price."
