Jared W.,"Pros: Modern warfare & apex legends @ 110-140+fps. Gsync looks flawless, even on a freesync monitor. Stays fairly chill @ max load roughly 75c w/ oc. Was able to get +100mhz to the core and +800mhz to the memory with ease, could probably push it a bit further and it's pretty quiet too.Cons: None"
Petr S.,"Pros: - Supports 4 monitors at the same timeCons: - For multi-monitor support on Windows 10, there is a setting in the NVidia Control Panel that needs to be changed (NVCP > Adjust desktop size and position > Scaling: Change from ""Display"" to ""GPU""). Without that change, monitors repeatedly freeze, go black, etc. I wish ""GPU"" was the factory default.Overall Review: After figuring out the correct Scaling setting, I am very happy with the card. I have 4 monitors (2x 1920x1200@60Hz, 2x 1920x1080@60Hz) and they all run great. I've tried running 4 different videos on each monitor and running 1 video across all 4, and the card handles it with no problems. I don't play any games but often have trading software on 1 or 2 monitors, video on another monitor, and Outlook and/or Excel and/or remote desktop on the others and don't have any issues. As far as I can tell, the card runs pretty cool and quiet at the default settings."
Ryan S.,"Pros: -runs games well
-no issues
-Factory overclocked
-good priceOverall Review: I would recommend the 1660 super for any moderate or budget build if the money permits, smoothly runs all my games and have had no issue with it yet!"
Anonymous,Pros: Price and Value. Pair this with AMD 3600 for amazing 1080P gaming.Overall Review: Excellent
David B.,"Pros: Great 1080p card
Runs without overheating - only 65c under load.
Fans are relatively quiet.Cons: May not run 1440p screens at Max graphics settings.Overall Review: So far so good.  Card arrived in new sealed packaging in excellent condition.  Very easy to swap out my old card.  Noticed immediate graphics frame rate improvement of about a 50% performance increase.  I don't have the monitors (or space) to see how it performs with triple screens.  I also don't have a 144hz monitor to test with.  Overall though I'm happy with this video card."
Griffin V.,"Pros: -Runs every game I have at top graphics with no issues! I've never seen it even go past 50%
-Reliable
-Easy to configure
-Fantastic priceCons: -I know that for some people fan noise is important, so a con might be the fan noise as it is a little audible but with headphones on/in I can't hear anythingOverall Review: I would absolutely recommend this card to other people trying to game on a budget! I have nothing bad to say with my experience so far and I hope others can enjoy this card as much as I do!"
Anonymous,"Pros: Nice and quietCons: It ain't thinOverall Review: Not a gamer, so not going to comment that way. But I wanted a speedy card for Adobe's ""awesome"" software, and this does the job well. (Photo, not video editing.)"
Peter D.,"Pros: Drastic improvement compared to my ASUS GTX 660 Ti (as expected) that I've been running since 2013. Benchmark stats and performance per dollar ranked this card extremely high and I'm not disappointed.  I've gone from low settings to Ultra on all games. The backplate on the card is a nice addition both aesthetically and structurally.Cons: While I understand that DisplayPort is better than HDMI, it would have been nice if it was split into 2HDMI : 2 DisplayPort connections instead of 1:3 for the sake of lazy consumer convenience.Overall Review: Great card running perfectly with no regrets."
