      "- Subpar Cooling.Overall Review: It is worth the money to get one of the Corsair, NZXT,  Cooler Master, etc. higher priced AIOs. They are much quieter and much better at cooling your CPU. I had the air cooler that came with my RYZEN 2750 and it was quieter and cooler than this RAIJINTEK EOS 240 RBW. If it's RGB lighting you want, some of the major brands offer them as well.\n",

      "Easy to follow instructionsCons: A cluster mess of cablesOverall Review: As most of our systems already had adequate cooling I decided to test this one out on my son's pc.  The hardware is a little dated, but I figured the i7 3770s would still give this a proper run.  Keep in mind that no other changes were made to the system, except that this cooler did improve the airflow slightly.  Room temp was 71°F.\n",

      "There is a hot mess of cables that could have easily been simplified.  Each fan has 2 cables, and the pump has a power cable that connects to sata power, and has the RGB cable too.  For those of us that pride ourselves on cable management this is a disaster, and I had to knock 1 egg off for that.  Don't let that deter you from purchasing this cooler.  It still performs amazingly.\n",
